# Fake-News-Detection
Hey, Unique Adhikari here! This little project shows how to find fake news on the internet, using regression techniques.

First, you gotta get some data. Head over to Kaggle and download your dataset.
Then, rename the files to "True.csv" and "False.csv".
Finally, run the Jupiter or Streamlit file to see the results.
